Getting Started
===============
On this page you will find all the information to get started with HGC.
Basic knowledge of programming in Python is assumed, but nothing more than
that.

Getting Python
--------------
Python 3.7

Installation
------------
pip install hgc

Conventions
-----------
The naming conventions of the column names is that they are all in lower case with
an underscore between separate words. E.g. the EC measured in the lab is indicated with
`ec_lab`. The only exception to this is the notation of chemical structures and atoms; there standard capitalization
is used. E.g. the column name for total total nitrogen is `N_total` and for ortho-phosphate `PO4_ortho`.
